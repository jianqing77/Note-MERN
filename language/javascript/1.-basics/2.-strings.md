# 2. Strings

In JavaScript, strings are indexed like arrays, with the first character at index 0. You can access individual characters in a string using these indices

In JavaScript, strings are indexed like arrays, with the first character at index 0. You can access individual characters in a string using these indices.

Here's an overview of some commonly used string methods and properties in JavaScript:

1. **Casing:**
   *   `toUpperCase()`: This method converts a string to uppercase.

       ```javascript
       let str = 'Hello, World!';
       console.log(str.toUpperCase());  // Outputs: 'HELLO, WORLD!'
       ```
   *   `toLowerCase()`: This method converts a string to lowercase.

       ```javascript
       let str = 'Hello, World!';
       console.log(str.toLowerCase());  // Outputs: 'hello, world!'
       ```
2. **Trim:**
   *   `trim()`: This method removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

       ```javascript
       let str = '   Hello, World!   ';
       console.log(str.trim());  // Outputs: 'Hello, World!'
       ```
3. **Slice:**
   *   `slice(startIndex, endIndex)`: This method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string. The original string is not modified. The `endIndex` is not included in the extracted slice.

       ```javascript
       let str = 'Hello, World!';
       console.log(str.slice(7, 12));  // Outputs: 'World'
       ```
4. **indexOf:**
   *   `indexOf(searchValue, fromIndex)`: This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

       ```javascript
       let str = 'Hello, World!';
       console.log(str.indexOf('World'));  // Outputs: 7
       ```
5.  **Escapes:**

    1.  **New Line ()**: Inserts a line break.

        ```javascript
        let str1 = 'Hello\nWorld';
        console.log(str1);
        // Outputs:
        // Hello
        // World
        ```
    2.  **Tab ()**: Inserts a tab space.

        ```javascript
        let str2 = 'Hello\tWorld';
        console.log(str2);  // Outputs: 'Hello   World'
        ```
    3.  **Double Quote (`\"`)**: Inserts a double quote character.

        ```javascript
        let str3 = "He said, \"Hello World\"";
        console.log(str3);  // Outputs: 'He said, "Hello World"'
        ```
    4.  **Single Quote (`\'`)**: Inserts a single quote character.

        ```javascript
        let str4 = 'It\'s a beautiful day';
        console.log(str4);  // Outputs: 'It's a beautiful day'
        ```
    5.  **Backslash (`\\`)**: Inserts a backslash character.

        ```javascript
        let str5 = 'This is a backslash: \\';
        console.log(str5);  // Outputs: 'This is a backslash: \'
        ```
    6.  **Carriage Return ()**: Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line without advancing to the next line.

        ```javascript
        let str6 = '12345\rabc';
        console.log(str6);  // Outputs: 'abc45'
        ```
    7.  **Form Feed (`\f`)**: Moves the cursor to the next "page". It's a control character often used in printers.

        ```javascript
        let str7 = 'Hello\fWorld';
        console.log(str7);  // Outputs: 'Hello\u000CWorld'
        ```
    8.  **Backspace (`\b`)**: Inserts a backspace. This is not commonly used, as it does not behave as you might expect in a string.

        ```javascript
        let str8 = 'abcdef\b';
        console.log(str8);  // Outputs: 'abcdef\u0008'
        ```

    These escape sequences allow you to include special characters in your strings that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to include.
6. **Template Strings:**
   *   Template strings (also known as template literals) allow embedded expressions, multi-line strings, and string interpolation. They are enclosed by backtick characters ( \`).

       ```javascript
       let name = 'John';
       let greeting = `Hello, ${name}! How are you?`;
       console.log(greeting);  // Outputs: 'Hello, John! How are you?'
       ```
   * In the above example, `${name}` is a placeholder for the `name` variable. The expression inside the placeholder (`name` in this case) is evaluated and its result is converted to a string and inserted into the template string.

These are just a few examples of the string methods available in JavaScript. There are many others, and I recommend checking out the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\_Objects/String) for a more comprehensive list.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**String Length**</mark>

In JavaScript, you can determine the length of a string (i.e., the number of characters in the string) by using the `length` property of the string object.

Here's an example:

```javascript
let str = "Hello, World!";
console.log(str.length);  // Outputs: 13
```

In this example, `str.length` returns the number of characters in the string `str`. In this case, it includes the characters `H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, `o`, `,`, , `W`, `o`, `r`, `l`, `d`, `!`.

Note that the `length` property counts all characters, including spaces and punctuation. Also, unlike many methods in JavaScript, `length` is a property, not a function, so you don't use parentheses with it.
