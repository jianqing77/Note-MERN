# 1. Data Types

> JavaScript provides multiple types of data to handle various kinds of tasks.&#x20;
>
> They can be divided into two main categories:&#x20;
>
> * Primitive (or Basic) data types&#x20;
> * Non-primitive (or Reference) data types.

<details>

<summary>JS: Primitive Types</summary>

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**String**</mark>**:** Represents a series of characters (text). Strings are written inside quotes.

    ```javascript
    let str = "Hello, world!";
    ```

<!---->

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**Number**</mark>**:** Represents numeric values, including integers and floats.

    <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">let integer = 10;
    let floatingPoint = 10.5;

    <strong>// JavaScript has only one type of number, numbers can be written with or without decimals.
    </strong>let number1 = 34; // integer
    let number2 = 34.00; // floating point
    // Very large or very small numbers can be written using scientific (exponential) notation.javascriptCopy
    let bigNumber = 123e5;      // 12300000
    let smallNumber = 123e-5;   // 0.00123
    // JavaScript numbers can also be Objects, usually defined with the new keyword.javascriptCopy
    let x = new Number(123); // creates a number object
    // Arithmetic operations can also return Infinity or -Infinity.javascriptCopy
    let result = 2 / 0; // result will be Infinity
    </code></pre>

<!---->

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**Boolean**</mark>**:** Represents logical values and can only be `true` or `false`.

    ```javascript
    let isTrue = true;
    let isFalse = false;
    ```

<!---->

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**Undefined**</mark>**:** This type is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value.

    ```javascript
    let noValue;
    console.log(noValue); // Outputs: undefined
    ```

<!---->

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**Null**</mark>**:** This type has one value, `null`, and is explicitly assigned to a variable to denote that it's empty or does not exist.

    ```javascript
    let emptyValue = null;
    ```

<!---->

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**BigInt**</mark>**:** This is a newer data type in JavaScript and can be used to store numbers larger than `9007199254740991`, which is the limit for the `Number` data type.

    ```javascript
    let bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
    ```

<!---->

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**Symbol**</mark>**:** This is a unique and immutable data type that is often used as an identifier for object properties.

    ```javascript
    let sym = Symbol('description');
    ```

</details>

<details>

<summary>JS: Reference Types</summary>

1.  <mark style="color:yellow;">**Object**</mark>**:** Allows you to store collections of data.

    ```javascript
    let person = {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    };
    ```
2.  <mark style="color:yellow;">**Array**</mark>**:** A special type of object used for storing multiple values in a single variable.

    ```javascript
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
    ```
3.  <mark style="color:yellow;">**Function**</mark>**:** Functions are a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.

    ```javascript
    function greet() {
      return "Hello, world!";
    }
    ```
4.  <mark style="color:yellow;">**Date**</mark>**:** JavaScript Date objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format.

    ```javascript
    let date = new Date();
    ```
5.  <mark style="color:yellow;">**RegExp**</mark>**:** Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.

    ```javascript
    let re = /ab+c/;
    ```
6. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet**</mark>**:** These are advanced data structures introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).

Note: Besides the primitive data types, all other types in JavaScript are objects.

<summary>Difference between:  <mark style="color:yellow;">Undefined</mark> &#x26; <mark style="color:yellow;">null</mark></summary>

In JavaScript, `undefined` and `null` are both special values, and while they are somewhat similar, they have different uses and meanings.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Undefined:**</mark>

*   A variable that has been <mark style="color:blue;">**declared but has not been assigned a value,**</mark> is actually `undefined`.

    ```javascript
    let testVar;
    console.log(testVar); // Outputs: undefined
    ```
*   Also, an object property or array element that does not exist is `undefined`.

    ```javascript
    let obj = {};
    console.log(obj.propertyDoesNotExist); // Outputs: undefined

    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    console.log(arr[5]); // Outputs: undefined
    ```
*   Functions without a return statement, or with an empty return statement, return `undefined`.

    ```javascript
    function testFunc() {}
    console.log(testFunc()); // Outputs: undefined
    ```

**Null:**

*   `null` is a value that <mark style="color:blue;">**represents no value or no object**</mark>. It is often used to indicate that a variable should have no value.

    ```javascript
    let testVar = null;
    console.log(testVar); // Outputs: null
    ```
*   `null` is an intentional absence of any object value. It is often used when you want to explicitly clear an object.

    ```javascript
    let obj = {name: "John", age: 22};
    obj = null; // Now, obj does not have a value
    console.log(obj); // Outputs: null
    ```

**The difference:**

* `undefined` means a variable has been declared but no value has been assigned to it.
* `null` is an assignment value that means no value or no object. It needs to be assigned to a variable to indicate that the variable has no value.
* In JavaScript, `undefined` is a type itself whereas `null` is an object.
*   `null` and `undefined` are not strictly equal (`==`), but they are loosely equal. This means that `null == undefined` is true while `null === undefined` is false.

    ```javascript
    console.log(undefined == null); // Outputs: true
    console.log(undefined === null); // Outputs: false
    ```

<summary>Difference between:  <mark style="color:yellow;">==</mark> &#x26; <mark style="color:yellow;">===</mark></summary>

In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are both comparison operators, but they operate differently when it comes to type coercion.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Double Equals (==) - Loose Equality:**</mark>

* The double equals operator `==` <mark style="color:blue;">**performs an automatic type conversion if needed**</mark>. It is known as a loose equality operator.
*   If the two variables being compared have different types, JavaScript tries to convert one or both of them to a common type before making the comparison.

    ```javascript
    console.log(123 == '123');  // Outputs: true
    console.log(true == 1);     // Outputs: true
    console.log(null == undefined);  // Outputs: true
    ```

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Triple Equals (===) - Strict Equality:**</mark>

*   The triple equals operator `===` <mark style="color:blue;">**does not perform type conversion.**</mark> It <mark style="color:yellow;">**checks**</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;">**both the data value and type,**</mark> which means a string value will not equal a numeric value of the same content.

    ```javascript
    console.log(123 === '123');  // Outputs: false
    console.log(true === 1);     // Outputs: false
    console.log(null === undefined);  // Outputs: false
    ```
* It is generally recommended to use the `===` operator rather than `==` to avoid unexpected results due to type coercion.

**In Summary:**

* `==` checks for equality after performing any necessary type conversions.
* `===` checks for equality without performing type conversion. If the types of the two variables are different, it will not convert either one to a common type - it will simply return `false`.

So, if you want to check for both type and value equality, use `===`. If you want to check for value equality after type coercion, use `==`.

<summary>Increment Operator Explanation: <mark style="color:yellow;">i++ vs ++i</mark> in JS</summary>

In JavaScript, `i++` and `++i` are both increment operators and they both increase the value of `i` by 1. However, the difference between them is the value they return:

*   `i++` (Postfix Increment): This is the "post-increment" operator. It increases the value of `i` by 1, but the value of the expression is the original value of `i` before the increment. In other words, it returns the value first and then increments.

    ```javascript
    let i = 5;
    console.log(i++);  // Outputs: 5
    console.log(i);  // Outputs: 6
    ```
*   `++i` (Prefix Increment): This is the "pre-increment" operator. It increases the value of `i` by 1, and the value of the expression is the new value of `i` after the increment. In other words, it increments first and then returns the value.

    ```javascript
    let i = 5;
    console.log(++i);  // Outputs: 6
    console.log(i);  // Outputs: 6
    ```

In both of these examples, `i` ends up as 6. But in the first example, with `i++`, the first `console.log` statement outputs 5, because the increment happens after the value is returned. In the second example, with `++i`, the first `console.log` statement outputs 6, because the increment happens before the value is returned.

So, if you're just incrementing a value and not using the returned value in the same statement, `i++` and `++i` will behave the same. But if you're using the returned value in the same statement (like in an assignment expression or a function argument), they will behave differently.

<summary>NaN </summary>

`NaN` is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number.

```javascript
let notANumber = 100 / "Apple";  // notANumber will be NaN
```

`NaN` is contagious. Any arithmetic operation with `NaN` will have a result of `NaN`

```javascript
let result = 100 + NaN;  // result will be NaN
```

You can detect if a value is `NaN` using the `isNaN()` global function

```javascript
let isItNaN = isNaN(100 / "Apple");  // isItNaN will be true
```

<summary>JS: Variables</summary>

* Variables are containers for storing data values.
* Declaration: let, var, const
*   JavaScript variables are <mark style="color:yellow;">**dynamically typed**</mark> which means the same variable can be used to hold different data types.

    ```javascript
    let data = "Hello"; // data is a string
    data = 100; // data is a number
    ```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Variable Declaration: <strong>let, var, const</strong></summary>

In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are three ways to declare variables, and they each have different behaviors with respect to scope, hoisting, and reassignment.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**let**</mark>**:**

*   `let` is block-scoped, meaning a variable declared with `let` is only accessible within the block `{}` it is declared in.

    <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">if (true) {
      let y = 20;
    <strong>  console.log(y); // Outputs: 20
    </strong>}
    console.log(y); // Outputs: ReferenceError: y is not defined
    </code></pre>
*   Like `var`, `let` variables are hoisted to the top of their block, but accessing them before the declaration will result in a `ReferenceError`.

    ```javascript
    console.log(y); // Outputs: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
    let y = 5;
    ```
*   Variables declared with `let` <mark style="color:red;">**can be reassigned**</mark> <mark style="color:red;">**but not redeclared**</mark> within their scope.

    ```javascript
    let y = 10;
    y = 20;  // reassignment
    let y = 30;  // SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
    ```

<mark style="color:yellow;">**const**</mark>**:**

* `const` has the same scoping rules as `let` - it's block-scoped.
* `const` variables are also hoisted to the top of their block, but accessing them before the declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
*   Variables declared with `const` <mark style="color:red;">**cannot be reassigned or redeclared.**</mark>

    ```javascript
    const z = 10;
    z = 20;  // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
    const z = 30;  // SyntaxError: Identifier 'z' has already been declared
    ```
*   However, if a `const` variable is an object or an array, its properties can be changed, because these are mutable data structures.

    ```javascript
    const arr = [1, 2, 3];
    arr.push(4);  // This is allowed
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];  // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
    ```

<mark style="color:yellow;">**var**</mark>**:**

*   `var` is <mark style="color:red;">**function-scoped**</mark>, meaning a variable declared with `var` is accessible within the function it is declared in. <mark style="color:green;">**If it's declared outside any function, it's globally scoped.**</mark>

    ```javascript
    function test() {
      var x = 10;
      console.log(x); // Outputs: 10
    }
    test();
    console.log(x); // Outputs: ReferenceError: x is not defined
    ```
*   Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means they can be used before they're declared, but they will return `undefined` until they are actually defined.

    ```javascript
    console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
    var x = 5;
    ```
*   Variables declared with `var` can be both reassigned and redeclared within their scope.

    ```javascript
    var x = 10;
    x = 20;  // reassignment
    var x = 30;  // redeclaration
    ```

In conclusion, `var` is function-scoped and allows reassignment and redeclaration. `let` is block-scoped and allows reassignment but not redeclaration. `const` is block-scoped, does not allow reassignment or redeclaration, but allows properties of objects and elements of arrays to be changed. It's generally recommended to use `let` and `const` over `var` in modern JavaScript for better control over variable scope and mutability.



<mark style="color:red;">**Here are some important notes:**</mark>

* **Scope**: `var` is function-scoped, while `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
* **Hoisting**: All are hoisted, but `let` and `const` are not initialized until their definition is evaluated, hence accessing them beforehand results in a `ReferenceError`.
* **Reassignment**: `var` and `let` can be reassigned, but `const` cannot.
* **Redeclaration**: `var` can be redeclared in the same scope, while `let` and `const` cannot.
* **Mutable properties**: If a variable (regardless of whether it's `var`, `let`, or `const`) is an object or an array, its properties or elements can be changed, because these are mutable data structures. However, if you try to assign a new array or object to a `const` variable, it will throw an error.

<summary>Random Number</summary>

In JavaScript, you can generate a random number using the `Math.random()` function. This function returns a floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Here is an example of generating a random number:

```javascript
let randomNumber = Math.random();
console.log(randomNumber);
```

This will output a random floating-point number between 0 and 1, like `0.1234567894321`.

If you want to generate a random integer between two values, you can use this function:

```javascript
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
    min = Math.ceil(min);
    max = Math.floor(max);
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min; //The maximum is inclusive and the minimum is inclusive 
}

console.log(getRandomInt(1, 10));  // Outputs a random integer from 1 to 10
```

In this example, `Math.ceil(min)` ensures that the minimum number is rounded up to the nearest integer, and `Math.floor(max)` ensures the maximum number is rounded down to the nearest integer. `Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min` generates a random integer in the specified range. The maximum and minimum are inclusive.
