<summary>syntax 1: Getter / Setter Method </summary>

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 10.59.41 PM.png>)

In TypeScript, you can create a class with fields (properties) and methods like this:

```typescript
class Customers {
  private firstName: string;
  private lastName: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  // getters
  public getFirstName(): string {
    return this.firstName;
  }

  public getLastName(): string {
    return this.lastName;
  }

  // setters
  public setFirstName(firstName: string): void {
    this.firstName = firstName;
  }

  public setLastName(lastName: string): void {
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}
```

In this code, `firstName` and `lastName` are made `private`, meaning they can't be accessed directly from outside the class. If you try to do something like `console.log(customer.firstName)`, TypeScript will give an error.

To access and modify these `private` fields, you can use `get` and `set` methods. These are often called "getter" and "setter" methods. In the above code, `getFirstName`, `getLastName`, `setFirstName`, and `setLastName` are getter and setter methods for `firstName` and `lastName`.

Here's an example of how you can use this class:

```typescript
let customer = new Customers("John", "Doe");

console.log(customer.getFirstName()); // Outputs: John
console.log(customer.getLastName());  // Outputs: Doe

customer.setFirstName("Jane");
customer.setLastName("Smith");

console.log(customer.getFirstName()); // Outputs: Jane
console.log(customer.getLastName());  // Outputs: Smith
```

In this example, we create a new `Customers` object with the first name "John" and the last name "Doe". Then we use the getter methods to access these properties and print them. Finally, we use the setter methods to change the first name to "Jane" and the last name to "Smith", and then print the updated names.

<summary>syntax 2: use accessors</summary>

In TypeScript, you can use accessors (`get` and `set`) to create methods that read and write the values of a private field. This allows you to control how that field is accessed and modified.



Here's how you can update the `Customers` class to use accessors:

```typescript
class Customers {
  private _firstName: string;
  private _lastName: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
  }

  // getters
  get firstName(): string {
    return this._firstName;
  }

  get lastName(): string {
    return this._lastName;
  }

  // setters
  set firstName(firstName: string) {
    this._firstName = firstName;
  }

  set lastName(lastName: string) {
    this._lastName = lastName;
  }
}
```

In this code, we prepend an underscore `_` to the private field names to differentiate them from the accessor methods. Now, you can access `firstName` and `lastName` as if they were public fields, but behind the scenes, you're calling the accessor methods:

```typescript
let customer = new Customers("John", "Doe");

console.log(customer.firstName); // Outputs: John
console.log(customer.lastName);  // Outputs: Doe

customer.firstName = "Jane";
customer.lastName = "Smith";

console.log(customer.firstName); // Outputs: Jane
console.log(customer.lastName);  // Outputs: Smith
```

In this example, the syntax for getting and setting the `firstName` and `lastName` fields is more concise and similar to accessing regular public fields. However, you're still using the `get` and `set` methods behind the scenes, which gives you control over how these fields are accessed and modified.
