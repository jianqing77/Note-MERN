# TypeScript

### Benefit compared with JS

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Static Typing**</mark>: TypeScript <mark style="color:blue;">**introduces types to JavaScript**</mark>. This means you can assign types to your variables, function parameters, and object properties. This can help catch and prevent bugs and errors during compile time (before the code runs), which JavaScript, being a dynamically typed language, cannot do.
2. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**</mark>: While JavaScript does support OOP, TypeScript makes it easier to use with features like <mark style="color:blue;">**classes, interfaces, inheritance**</mark>, etc. TypeScript offers better syntax and more features for object-oriented programming, making it easier to organize large codebases and work in a team.
3. **Classes, Interfaces, Generics, etc**: TypeScript adds several features from other languages such as Java and C#. This includes <mark style="color:blue;">**classes, interfaces, generics, and namespaces,**</mark> which can make it easier for developers from a Java or .NET background to work with TypeScript.
4. **IDE Support**: Due to TypeScript's static typing feature, IDEs or text editors like Visual Studio Code can provide better autocompletion, type checking, and syntax highlighting. This makes the developer experience much better and also helps in reducing the number of runtime errors.
