# 6. Inheritance and Implementation

**TypeScript Inheritance and Implementation:**

* TypeScript classes <mark style="color:yellow;">**support single inheritance**</mark>, similar to many other object-oriented languages. This means a class can inherit properties and methods from a single parent class.
  * TypeScript uses the <mark style="color:red;">`extends`</mark> keyword to set up inheritance between classes.
* TypeScript also supports the i<mark style="color:yellow;">**mplementation of interfaces**</mark> using the <mark style="color:red;">`implements`</mark> keyword. A class implementing an interface must adhere to the structure of the interface.
  * Multiple interfaces can be implemented in a single class, providing a way to mix different capabilities into a class.
* TypeScript allows for <mark style="color:yellow;">**static properties and methods**</mark> in a class, which can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Inheritance</mark>: <code>extend</code> => <mark style="color:blue;">parent &#x26; child</mark> classes</summary>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Parent Class (Base Class):**</mark>

* Defines a constructor, which is a special method for creating and initializing an object of that class.
* Defines methods that can be shared with child classes.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Child Class (Derived Class):**</mark>

* Defines a constructor, which can add new properties and uses the `super()` function to call the parent class constructor.
* Can override methods defined in the parent class. Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class.
* Can add new methods that are specific to the child class.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Example**</mark>

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-28 at 5.19.09 PM.png>)

<mark style="color:orange;">**Shape Class:**</mark>

```typescript
export class Shape {
  constructor(private _x: number, 
              private _y: number) {
  }
  
  // get/set accessors ...
  getInfo(): string {
    return `x=${this._x}, y=${this._y}`;
  }
}
```

In this code, a `Shape` class is defined with two private fields `_x` and `_y`. The `private` keyword restricts the access of these fields to the class they are defined in.

The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object of the class. Here, it accepts two arguments which are used to initialize the `_x` and `_y` fields.

The `getInfo` method returns a string that includes the values of `_x` and `_y`.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Circle Class:**</mark>

```typescript
import { Shape } from './Shape';
export class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(theX: number, 
              theY: number, 
              private _radius: number) {
    super(theX, theY);
  }
  
  // get/set accessors ...
  getInfo(): string {
    return super.getInfo() + `, radius=${this._radius}`;
  }
  
}
```

In this code, a `Circle` class is defined which extends the `Shape` class. This means that `Circle` inherits all of the members (properties and methods) from `Shape`.

The `constructor` method of `Circle` accepts three arguments: `theX`, `theY`, and `_radius`. The first two arguments are passed to the `super` method, which calls the constructor of the parent class (`Shape`). The third argument is used to initialize the `_radius` field of `Circle`.

The `getInfo` method of `Circle` overrides the `getInfo` method of `Shape`. It first calls the `getInfo` method of `Shape` using `super.getInfo()` and then appends the `radius` information to the returned string.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Usage:**</mark>

```typescript
import { Shape } from './Shape';
import { Circle } from './Circle';
let myShape = new Shape(10, 15);
console.log(myShape.getInfo());
let myCircle = new Circle(5, 10, 20);
console.log(myCircle.getInfo());
```

Here, instances of `Shape` and `Circle` are created using the `new` keyword followed by the class name and arguments to pass to the constructor. The `getInfo` method is then called on these instances, and the returned string is logged to the console. The output will be:

```
x=10, y=15
x=5, y=10, radius=20
```

This shows that `Shape` and `Circle` objects are working as expected, with `Circle` correctly inheriting from `Shape` and adding its own `radius` information.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Inheritance</mark>: extend => <mark style="color:blue;">abstract &#x26; concrete</mark> classes</summary>

The relationship between abstract classes and concrete (non-abstract) classes in TypeScript and other object-oriented programming languages is indeed a demonstration of inheritance.

* An abstract class provides a base structure or blueprint that other classes can extend.
* When a concrete class extends an abstract class, it inherits all the properties and methods of the abstract class.&#x20;
* The concrete class can also provide implementations for any abstract methods declared in the abstract class.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Abstract Class:**</mark>

* An abstract class is a class that <mark style="color:blue;">**cannot be instantiated on its own**</mark>. It is <mark style="color:red;">**designed to be extended by other classes.**</mark>
* An abstract class can contain <mark style="color:blue;">**BOTH fully implemented methods (concrete methods) and abstract methods (methods with no implementation).**</mark>
* Abstract methods must be implemented by any non-abstract child class that <mark style="color:red;">**extends**</mark> the abstract class.
* Abstract classes provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Concrete (non-abstract) class**</mark>

* When a concrete (non-abstract) class extends an abstract class, it <mark style="color:red;">**must provide an implementation for all abstract methods declared in the abstract class.**</mark>&#x20;
* If it does not, then the concrete class must also be declared as abstract.
* A concrete class that extends an abstract class can  define its own constructor. However, it must call `super()` in its constructor to ensure the constructor of the parent (abstract) class is called first.

**Animal.ts**

```typescript
export abstract class Animal {
  
  // abstract class 
  constructor(public name: string) {}
  
  // abstract method
  abstract makeSound(): void;

  // concrete method
  eat(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating...`);
  }
}
```

In this file, an abstract `Animal` class is defined with a `name` property, a `makeSound` abstract method, and an `eat` method.

**Dog.ts**

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript">import { Animal } from './Animal';

export class Dog <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">extends Animal</a> {
  
  constructor(name: string, public breed: string) {
    super(name);
  }
  
  // provide implementation of the abstract method defined in abstract class
  makeSound() {
    console.log('Woof! Woof!');
  }
}
</code></pre>

In this file, a `Dog` class is defined that extends the `Animal` class. It provides an implementation for the `makeSound` method.

**Cat.ts**

```typescript
import { Animal } from './Animal';

export class Cat extends Animal {

 // provide implementation of the abstract method defined in abstract class
  makeSound() {
    console.log('Meow! Meow!');
  }
}
```

In this file, a `Cat` class is defined that extends the `Animal` class. It provides an implementation for the `makeSound` method.

**main.ts**

```typescript
import { Dog } from './Dog';
import { Cat } from './Cat';

let dog = new Dog('Buster', 'Goolden Doodle');
dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: 'Woof! Woof!'
dog.eat(); // Outputs: 'Buster is eating...'

let cat = new Cat('Whiskers');
cat.makeSound(); // Outputs: 'Meow! Meow!'
cat.eat(); // Outputs: 'Whiskers is eating...'
```

In this main file, instances of `Dog` and `Cat` are created and methods are called on these instances. The output shows that the `Dog` and `Cat` classes are working as expected, correctly inheriting from the `Animal` abstract class and providing their own implementation for the `makeSound` method.

<summary>Difference between parent &#x26; abstract classes in inheritance</summary>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Abstract Class:**</mark>** **<mark style="color:green;">**with abstract keyword**</mark>

* Abstract classes are classes that <mark style="color:red;">**cannot be instantiated directly**</mark>**.** <mark style="color:blue;">They exist for other classes to extend and form a base template structure</mark>.
* Abstract classes can have abstract methods (methods declared without an implementation) that must be implemented in any direct concrete (i.e., non-abstract) subclass.
* They are a design tool to create reusable code and model concepts that are too abstract to have a direct instance of.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Parent (or Base) Class:**</mark>

* A parent class (or base class) <mark style="color:red;">**can be instantiated**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">It's a fully conceived class that can create objects, not just a template.</mark>
* It can also be extended by child classes, and methods and properties of the parent class get inherited by child classes.
* However, it doesn't have abstract methods. All methods in a regular parent class should have an implementation.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**The**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">** **</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**`abstract`**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">** **</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**keyword is used when we don't want a class to be instantiated directly, but instead want it to be extended by other classes**</mark>. The `abstract` keyword can also be used to declare abstract methods within an abstract class.

**1. Implementing Simple Interface**

```typescript
interface IDrivable {
  start(): void;
  drive(distance: number): void;
  stop(): void;
}

class Car implements IDrivable {
  start() {
    console.log('Car started');
  }

  drive(distance: number) {
    console.log(`Car drove ${distance} kilometers`);
  }

  stop() {
    console.log('Car stopped');
  }
}

let myCar = new Car();
myCar.start(); // Outputs: 'Car started'
myCar.drive(50); // Outputs: 'Car drove 50 kilometers'
myCar.stop(); // Outputs: 'Car stopped'
```

**2. Implementing Interface with Properties**

```typescript
interface IAnimal {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  makeSound(): void;
}

class Dog implements IAnimal {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}

  makeSound() {
    console.log('Woof! Woof!');
  }
}

let myDog = new Dog('Buster', 5);
console.log(myDog.name); // Outputs: 'Buster'
console.log(myDog.age); // Outputs: 5
myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs: 'Woof! Woof!'
```

**3. Implementing Multiple Interfaces**

```typescript
interface ICanFly {
  fly(height: number): void;
}

interface ICanSwim {
  swim(distance: number): void;
}

class Duck implements ICanFly, ICanSwim {
  fly(height: number) {
    console.log(`Duck flew ${height} meters high`);
  }

  swim(distance: number) {
    console.log(`Duck swam ${distance} meters`);
  }
}

let myDuck = new Duck();
myDuck.fly(10); // Outputs: 'Duck flew 10 meters high'
myDuck.swim(20); // Outputs: 'Duck swam 20 meters'
```

In these examples, the `Car`, `Dog`, and `Duck` classes are implementing `IDrivable`, `IAnimal`, `ICanFly`, and `ICanSwim` interfaces respectively. The classes provide the necessary methods and properties as dictated by the interfaces.
